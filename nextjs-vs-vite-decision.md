# Next.js vs Vite Decision

## Why this example uses Next.js

The Liveblocks example we started from uses Next.js because:

1. **API Routes**: Liveblocks requires server-side authentication endpoints (`/api/liveblocks-auth` and `/api/ai-auth`). Next.js provides these out-of-the-box, while Vite would require a separate backend server.

2. **Official Example**: The official Liveblocks + tldraw example uses Next.js, making it easier to follow their patterns and get support.

3. **Deployment**: Vercel (Next.js creator) provides one-click deployment with automatic API route handling.

## Why you might prefer Vite

1. **Development Speed**: Vite is significantly faster for HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and initial startup. You're experiencing this with the 26s startup time.

2. **Simplicity**: Vite has less "magic" and is easier to understand, especially for teams already familiar with it.

3. **Bundle Size**: Vite typically produces smaller, more optimized bundles.

## Can you use Vite with tldraw + Liveblocks?

**Yes, absolutely!** Here's what you'd need:

### Option 1: Vite + Separate Backend
```
productpeer/
├── frontend/          # Vite + React + tldraw
│   ├── src/
│   └── vite.config.ts
└── backend/           # Kotlin/Micronaut (or Node.js)
    └── api/
        ├── liveblocks-auth
        └── ai-endpoints
```

### Option 2: Vite + Serverless Functions
- Use Netlify Functions or Vercel Functions for auth endpoints
- Keep frontend in Vite
- Deploy to Netlify/Vercel

### Option 3: Vite + SST (Serverless Stack)
- Modern full-stack framework
- Vite for frontend
- AWS Lambda for backend
- Type-safe API layer

## Migration Path from this Example

If you decide to use Vite:

1. **Copy the React components**: All the tldraw integration code (`StorageTldraw.tsx`, `useStorageStore.ts`, etc.) works identically in Vite

2. **Move API routes to your backend**:
   ```typescript
   // In your Kotlin backend
   @Post("/api/liveblocks-auth")
   fun authenticateLiveblocks(@Body request: AuthRequest): AuthResponse {
       // Same logic as Next.js API route
   }
   ```

3. **Update environment variables**:
   ```typescript
   // Vite uses import.meta.env instead of process.env
   const client = createClient({
     authEndpoint: import.meta.env.VITE_AUTH_ENDPOINT
   });
   ```

## Recommendation

For ProductPeer's production deployment:
- **Use Vite** for the frontend (better DX, faster builds)
- **Use Kotlin/Micronaut** for the backend (as planned)
- The tldraw + Liveblocks integration code remains the same

This Next.js example is just for rapid prototyping. The core integration patterns (WebSocket connections, Storage sync, AI participation) work identically regardless of the framework.

## Development Speed Comparison

| Task | Next.js | Vite |
|------|---------|------|
| Initial startup | 20-30s | 1-3s |
| HMR update | 1-3s | <100ms |
| Production build | 30-60s | 10-20s |
| API routes | Built-in | Separate server |
| TypeScript | Built-in | Built-in |

## Conclusion

Next.js is used here for convenience (built-in API routes), but Vite is absolutely viable and likely better for your use case given your team's familiarity and the performance benefits.
